# Learn To Fly With Rust (eGUI)

This repo is the implementation of [the fantastic tutorial about Neural Network
and Genetic Algorithm](https://pwy.io/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/) by @Patryk27

This implementation has the only difference of using the [eGUI library](https://github.com/emilk/egui) to display
the UI instead of using WASM.

## Requirements

The app should run on any OS that has support for eGUI.
To install you need to have a rust toolchain installed and cargo (it has been
tested with Rust 1.76+)

To build the app simply run:
```
cargo build
```

To run, use this command instead:
```
cargo run
```
